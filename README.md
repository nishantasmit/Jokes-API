# Jokes-API
In this project, I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to manage a collection of jokes, implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API supports functionalities such as adding new jokes, retrieving specific or all jokes, updating existing jokes partially, and deleting individual or all jokes from the collection. To ensure secure operations, especially for bulk deletions, I implemented a user authentication mechanism using query parameters. The project demonstrates my ability to build and manage server-side applications, handle edge cases, and ensure secure and efficient data manipulation in a Node.js environment.
